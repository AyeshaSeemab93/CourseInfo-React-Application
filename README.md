## About the App

The application is created using Vite, a fast and opinionated React project setup. Vite offers a streamlined development experience with features like lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized build times.

### React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render when the data changes. 

### Vite

It achieves this by leveraging native ES Module imports during development, resulting in faster startup times. Vite is used to scaffold and build the React application in this project.
